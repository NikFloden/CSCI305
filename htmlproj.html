<h1> Text Editor </h1>
<p> For my text editor I chose vim as I already had it on my machine from CSCI112. For the tutorial I found a really nice interactive tutorial that I found on www.openvim.com. The tutorial went over the regular commands of vim and the 3 different modes of 
vim. </p>
<h1> Version control </h1>
<p> I already have git on my computer, so that's my VCS that I'm using. My tutorial  that I used was the tutorial here: http://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners. I learned how to make commits and branches by the command line. </p>
<h1> Final thoughts </h1>
<ol>
	<li>The next concept I would like to learn about my text editor is using the visual and normal modes better than I am at the moment. I am much more comfortable using insert mode rather than normal or visual.</li>
	<li>For my VCS it's branches and using the commmand line more. I'm much more used to using github's GUI instead of the command line. I have an idea of what branches do, but my understanding of it won't be cemented until I actually create a branch.</li>
	<li>Upon writing this, I've only made one commit, and that was to my github (If you wish to see the sorry state of my github, https://github.com/NikFloden).</li>
	<li> I would probably use better language, I'm still new to the idea of version control and I believe my commits to be a little informal.</li>
